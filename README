README for CHEM220B Solutions
=============================

=============================
Basic Use, for HW Solutions
=============================
To use, execute ./run.sh with argument HW#-SIM or HW#-DATA. 

Environmental variables:
CHEM220_IMGDIR    - Directory to save images to. If not set, defaults 
                    to ./image
CHEM220_DATDIR    - Directory to save data to. If not set, defaults to
                    ./data

NOTE: You can also export environment variables 
if you would like to run multiple assignments without passing the environment 
variable repeatedly.

NOTE: Jobs will run in the background after calling run.sh; use ps to examine
or kill running jobs.

EXAMPLE:
export CHEM220_IMDIR=$HOME/CHEM220B-output
export CHEM220_DATDIR=$HOME/CHEM220B-output
./run.sh HW1-SIM

TEST:
./run.sh TEST-MC

=============================
Advanced Use
=============================
Compile hardsphere.cc with appropriate flags (-D...) to turn on different
output and analysis modes. All output will be returned via stdout.

Flags:
VERBOSE      - Turn on standard warnings and talk. Leave off for 
               data generation
ACCEPTANCE   - Turn on acceptance rate print statements
XYZOUT       - Turn on XYZ position tracking for a particle
SMALLSPHERE  - Turn on single small-sphere Nv tracking
LARGESPHERE  - Turn on Nv tracking for a sphere of radius designated by
               passed argument
FOURIER      - Turn on fourier coefficient tracking
GR           - Turn on g(r) tracking

With any compilation, pass -h to query any flags that can be set in the 
program. Each flag type will turn on additional options within the
program, and not all modularities are yet added to the program.

Example:
g++ hardsphere.cc -o hardsphere-test -DVERBOSE -DXYZOUT -DACCEPTANCE
