README for CHEM220B Solutions
=============================
Example:
CHEM220_IMGDIR=/home/jhaberstroh/Dropbox/CHEM220B ./run.sh HW1-SIM

To use, execute ./run.sh with argument HW#-SIM or HW#-DATA. Pass -h to
query any flags that can be set in the programs.

Environmental variables:
CHEM220_IMGDIR    - Directory to save images to. If not set, defaults 
                    to ./image
CHEM220_DATDIR    - Directory to save data to. If not set, defaults to
                    ./data

Note about environment variables: You can also export environment variables 
if you would like to run multiple assignments without passing the environment 
variable repeatedly.

Example:
export CHEM220_IMDIR=/home/jhaberstroh/Dropbox/CHEM220B
./run.sh HW{1..3}-SIM
